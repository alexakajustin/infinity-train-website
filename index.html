          Infinity Train is an infinite, procedural generated survival game.
          <br />
          I've been working on Infinity Train for over a year now. I've scrapped
          and rewritten height generators, deleted and rebuilt erosion scripts,
          and reimplemented vegetation systems with different algorithms such as
          Poisson disc sampling more times than I can count. I've written custom
          grass shaders and experimented with distribution algorithms, all to
          achieve one thing: procedural worlds that generate at runtime and feel
          truly alive.

        <div style="font-size: 4vh; color: rgb(234, 255, 0)">The Goal</div>

        <div style="color: aqua">
          I'm trying to create environments that capture the magic of games like
          Minecraft and The Forest. I want to build something that gives players
          that feeling of motion, of discovering worlds that are constantly
          changing, unique, and beautiful.

        <div style="font-size: 4vh; color: rgb(234, 255, 0)">How It Works</div>
        <div style="color: rgb(255, 106, 0)">
          The game uses a multi-layered procedural generation system:
          <br />
          <div style="color: rgb(255, 68, 0)">
            <a
              style="color: rgb(255, 68, 0)"
              href="heightsgenerator.html"
              target="_blank"
              >Heights Generator</a
            >
          </div>
          <div style="color: rgb(255, 162, 0)">
            Multi-octave Perlin noise with asymmetric variations creates
            natural-looking landscapes. The erosion system uses particle
            simulation to carve realistic valleys and weathering patterns.
            Different falloff curves (linear, smooth-step, exponential) ensure
            terrain edges blend naturally.

          <div style="color: rgb(255, 162, 0)">
            Poisson disc sampling distributes trees naturally without overlap. A
            clustering system creates realistic forest patches. Grass generation
            uses patch-based density control, and everything respects terrain
            steepness so vegetation only grows where it makes sense.

          <div style="color: rgb(255, 162, 0)">
            Textures apply based on terrain steepness. Roads generate along
            chunk edges. Multiple alpha layers blend seamlessly, and the whole
            system streams textures for infinite worlds.

          <div style="color: rgb(154, 0, 0)">
            Everything runs in chunks with background threading. Coroutines
            handle generation without frame drops. The system supports
            cancellation and shows real-time progress. Memory management keeps
            infinite worlds running smooth. The technical complexity serves a
            simple purpose: making worlds that feel like real places you want to
            explore, where every hill and forest is unique and no two journeys
            are the same.

            <div style="color: rgb(205, 152, 255)">
              Working my ass off for years has led me to become a better person
              and to think more about life, not just game development. I
              realized, during the making of Infinity Train, that I always think
              I am a good programmer and developer, and whenever I run into a
              problem, I bash my head against the wall until it works. In that
              process, I am not a good dev anymore—not even after solving
              complex problems. So yeah, funnily enough, working more on
              games—complex games that need optimizations and not just simple
              stuff makes me think that there is always something to learn,
              something to strive for. I wouldn’t have liked it if it was easy.
              Of course, this game is not fun as of now; I am just focused on
              making the environment, but with time, probably a lot of years,
              something beautiful will be the end result. From the start, I
              decided that this game will be like a diary. I’ll be working on it
              my whole life, maybe, and in the meantime, I’ll make other games.
              But this is the one I will always come back to, to improve it,
              make it bigger, make it more fun, and more abstract!
